# Wu Tang Fortune generator
In this app you enter survey-like information and depending on what you enter your fortune will be told thru a wu-tang quote.




## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

I used an Array to store the quotes, and a conditional to determine how the quote shold appear

## Optimizations

It was initially a name generator, but I felt that a fortune generator would make it stick out a little more. I love Wu-Tang so I styled the page with the traditional killa bee colors, and made the positioning centered.
I just successfully made it a full stack app, by storing the fortunes into the database
